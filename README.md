# Northern Lights Alert

Northern Lights Alert is an application designed to notify users about opportunities to view the Northern Lights. The app is being developed in four phases, each introducing new features to improve the user experience and provide more functionality.

## Project Goals
- Provide alerts for Northern Lights viewing opportunities.
- Deliver personalized reports based on user preferences and weather conditions.
- Utilize predictive modeling to improve accuracy in forecasting viewing opportunities.

## Development Phases

### Phase 0: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP focuses on sending automated alerts when the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) forecasts a Kp index of 5 or higher, which indicates geomagnetic activity sufficient to view the Northern Lights in some locations.

Key Features:
- Scrapes NOAAâ€™s dashboard every 6 hours to check for a Kp index of 5 or higher.
- Sends alerts via email with the Kp level and forecasted date.
- Reliable backend to manage scheduling and alert distribution.

Technology Stack:
- Python for backend development and setup wizard GUI
- Scheduler: locally hosted through either task scheduler or cron job
- Alert System: MIME/SMTP for email
- Database: None needed, user info stored on users device in a JSON file

### Phase 1: Improved Core Product

In this phase, I will be focusing on improving all of the core functionality of the app and laying the ground work for future phases. This will include making the backend more light weight through the use of java, an improved GUI, and twillio support. I will also begin data aggregation for GIS data, Earth weather data, and Solar data. 

Key Features:
- Uses API keys for other data sources
- Twillio support
- Javascript for GUI
- Locally hosted database

Technology Stack:
- Python for webscraping
- Java for backemd
- Javascript for GUI
- SQLite for database management
- Twillio/SMTP
- AWS Lambda support for those who choose to deploy to the cloud

### Phase 2: Personalized Reports

In this phase, the app adds user-specific customization to the alerts, offering location-based recommendations for viewing the Northern Lights.

Key Features:
- User registration and profile management.
- A survey to capture user preferences, including location and driving radius.
- Recommendations for the top 5 viewing locations based on weather forecasts, Kp index, and user inputs.
- Integration with location services (e.g., Google Maps API) and weather data APIs.

Technology Stack Additions:
- React.js for the frontend interface.
- Database: PostgreSQL hosted with cloud provider TBD
- APIs: Weather and Location APIs TBD
- Authentication: Firebase

### Phase 3: Predictive Modeling

The final phase introduces proprietary predictive modeling to improve the accuracy of viewing recommendations.

Key Features:
- Collects and processes data from historical Kp levels, other solar weather measurements, weather conditions, and geo-coordinates of successful sightings
- Uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of viewing the Northern Lights in specific locations.
- Enhances personalized reports with more precise and reliable predictions.

Technology Stack Additions:
- Machine learning frameworks, most likely SciKit Learn
- Data pipeline tools TBD
- Big data storage and processing (e.g., AWS S3, Apache Spark).
- Visualization tools (e.g., Plotly Dash, Streamlit).

## General Infrastructure

### Tech Infrastructure
Cloud Hosting: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalability.
Database: SQLite for MVP; PostgreSQL or MySQL for later phases.
APIs: RESTful APIs for backend communication.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
Monitoring: Tools like New Relic or Sentry for application performance and error tracking.

### Version Control

The project is managed using Git with a public/private repository on GitHub. Versioning and updates will be tracked in the changelog.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Node.js for frontend development (Phase 1+).
Internet Access
Knowledge of Task Scheduler/Cron Jobs

### App Installation

1. Download the .exe file at dist/NorthernLightsApp.exe
2. Run file
3. Enter and save information using setup wizard
4. Schedule a task scheduler/cron job depending on OS. Set to run on startup

### Future Plans

- Expand to include global aurora alerts
- Develop a mobile app for iOS and Android
